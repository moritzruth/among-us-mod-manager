# Among Us Mod Manager
> Install and update Among Us mods with a single click*

*\*on PC. Only the Steam version is tested, but other ones should also work.*

## 📦 Install or update
Download [the latest installer](https://github.com/moritzruth/among-us-mod-manager/releases/download/v1.2.0/AmongUsModManagerInstaller-1.2.0.exe)
and execute it. It’s as simple as that.

You may encounter the following warning:

> Windows protected your PC: Windows Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.

You can safely ignore it by clicking "More info" and "Run anyway".
Removing this warning requires buying an expensive Code Signing license which I don’t have.

**Do not update the program while Among Us is running!**

### For advanced users
Alternatively, download
[the `.zip` archive](https://github.com/moritzruth/among-us-mod-manager/releases/download/v1.2.0/AmongUsModManager-1.2.0.zip),
extract it to a new directory and execute the file named `Among Us Mod Manager.exe`.
